# LLM-Playground

Welcome to the **LLM-Playground**!

This repository serves as my personal space for exploring and experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs). Here, I document my journey and projects related to understanding, utilizing, and applying various LLMs.

The purpose of this repository is to:

*   **Document Learning:** Keep track of experiments, code snippets, and notebooks related to LLMs.
*   **Showcase Projects:** Present small projects and use cases developed using LLMs.
*   **Explore Techniques:** Demonstrate different techniques like prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and working with various LLM architectures.
*   **Share Knowledge:** Potentially share insights and findings with others interested in LLMs.

Feel free to browse the notebooks and code examples. Each project or experiment will ideally have its own dedicated folder or notebook with explanations.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to explore the exciting world of Large Language Models!

**Content includes (but is not limited to):**

*   Notebooks exploring different LLM models (e.g., FLAN-T5, LLaMA, Mistral).
*   Examples of prompt engineering for various tasks (summarization, translation, text generation, etc.).
*   Code for loading and interacting with models using libraries like Hugging Face Transformers.
*   Small project implementations showcasing LLM capabilities.

**Getting Started:**

To run the notebooks and code in this repository, you will typically need:

*   Python (3.8+)
*   Libraries like `transformers`, `torch`, `numpy`, `pandas`, etc. (Check individual notebook requirements).
*   Access to a GPU might be beneficial or necessary for larger models.
